# what-im-watching
greasemonkey script that does a neat little highlight on the shows you're watchin on horriblesubs.

## To Install
This script is written for [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) running in Firefox. If you are using another user script extension/browser you may need to change some of the script information up top.

with Greasemonkey installed you should be able to navigate to the raw code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/McSlurryHole/what-im-watching/master/index.js) and be prompted to install.

if the prompt doesn't appear just click "new user script ..." in Greasemonkey and copy paste the code in there and save.
